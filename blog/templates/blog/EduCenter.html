<h2>52-Week High/Low</h2>
<p>A 52-week high/low is the highest and lowest price that a stock has traded at during the previous year. Many traders and investors view the 52-week high or low as an important factor in determining a stock's current value and predicting future price movement. As a stock trades within its 52-week price range (the range that exists between the 52-week low and the 52-week high), investors may show increased interest as price nears either the high or the low.</p>
<h2>Dividend Yield</h2>
<p>A financial ratio that indicates how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its share price. Dividend yield is represented as a percentage and can be calculated by dividing the dollar value of dividends paid in a given year per share of stock held by the dollar value of one share of stock. Yields for a current year are often estimated using the previous year's dividend yield or by taking the latest quarterly yield, multiplying by 4 (adjusting for seasonality) and dividing by the current share price.</p>
<h2>Trailing Price-To-Earnings (Trailing P/E)</h2>
<p>Trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) is calculated by taking the current stock price and dividing it by the trailing earnings per share (EPS) for the past 12 months. This measure differs from forward P/E, which uses earnings estimates for the next four quarters. As a result, forward P/E can sometimes be more relevant to investors when evaluating a company.</p>
<h2>Forward Price-To-Earnings (Forward P/E)</h2>
<p>Forward price-to-earnings (forward P/E) is a measure of the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio using forecasted earnings for the P/E calculation. While the earnings used are just an estimate and are not as reliable as current earnings data, there is still benefit in estimated P/E analysis. The forecasted earnings used in the formula can either be for the next 12 months or for the next full-year fiscal period.</p>
<h2>Price/Earnings-To-Growth (PEG Ratio)</h2>
<p>The price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. The PEG ratio is used to determine a stock's value while taking the company's earnings growth into account, and is considered to provide a more complete picture than the P/E ratio.</p>
<h2>Price-To-Sales Ratio (P/S Ratio)</h2>
<p>A valuation ratio that compares a company's stock price to its revenues. The price-to-sales ratio is an indicator of the value placed on each dollar of a company's sales or revenues. It can be calculated either by dividing the company's market capitalization by its total sales over a 12-month period, or on a per-share basis by dividing the stock price by sales per share for a 12-month period. Like all ratios, the price-to-sales ratio is most relevant when used to compare companies in the same sector. A low ratio may indicate possible undervaluation, while a ratio that is significantly above the average may suggest overvaluation. Abbreviated as the P/S ratio or PSR, this ratio is also known as a "sales multiple" or "revenue multiple."</p>
<h2>Price-To-Book Ratio (P/B Ratio)</h2>
<p>The price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) is a ratio used to compare a stock's market value to its book value. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share. A lower P/B ratio could mean that the stock is undervalued. However, it could also mean that something is fundamentally wrong with the company. As with most ratios, be aware that this varies by industry. This ratio also gives some idea of whether you're paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately. Also known as the "price-equity ratio."</p>
<h2>Book Value</h2>
<p>Book value of an asset is the value at which the asset is carried on a balance sheet and calculated by taking the cost of an asset minus the accumulated depreciation. Book value is also the net asset value of a company, calculated as total assets minus intangible assets (patents, goodwill) and liabilities. For the initial outlay of an investment, book value may be net or gross of expenses such as trading costs, sales taxes, service charges and so on.</p>
<h2>Market Capitalization</h2>
<p>Market capitalization refers the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares. Commonly referred to as "market cap," it is calculated by multiplying a company's shares outstanding by the current market price of one share. The investment community uses this figure to determine a company's size, as opposed to using sales or total asset figures.</p>
<h2>Operating Cash Flow (OCF)</h2>
<p>Operating cash flow is a measure of the amount of cash generated by a company's normal business operations. Operating cash flow indicates whether a company is able to generate sufficient positive cash flow to maintain and grow its operations, or it may require external financing for capital expansion. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require public companies to calculate operating cash flow using an indirect method by adjusting net income to cash basis using changes in non-cash accounts, such as depreciation, accounts receivable and changes in inventory.</p>
<h2>Price-To-Cash-Flow Ratio (Market per Cash Flow)</h2>
<p>The price-to-cash-flow ratio is the ratio of a stock's price to its cash flow per share. The ratio is an indicator of a stock's valuation. A ratio in the low single digits may indicate the stock is undervalued, while a higher ratio may suggest potential overvaluation. The ratio takes into consideration a stock's operating cash flow, which adds non-cash earnings such as depreciation and amortization to net income. It is especially useful for valuing stocks that have positive cash flow but are not profitable because of large non-cash charges. One way to calculate price-to-cash-flow is by taking the ratio of a company's market capitalization to its operating cash flow.</p>
<h2>Enterprise Multiple (Enterprise Value/EBITDA)</h2>
<p>An enterprise multiple is a ratio used to determine the value of a company. The enterprise multiple looks at a firm as a potential acquirer would, taking into account the company's debt, which other multiples like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio do not include. The multiple is also known as the EBITDA multiple.</p>
